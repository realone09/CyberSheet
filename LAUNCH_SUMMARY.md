| API breaking changes needed | Very Low | High | v1.0 frozen, breaking change policy enforced |
| Accessibility regressions | Very Low | High | 300+ a11y tests, CI/CD enforcement |
| Documentation gaps | Low | Medium | 15,000+ lines already, continuous updates |

**Overall Risk Level:** **VERY LOW**
